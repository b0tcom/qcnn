# Quantum-Enhanced Aiming Project

## Overview

This project integrates facial recognition, object detection, and quantum neural network processing to achieve accurate and smooth aiming algorithms. The models include a traditional YOLO object detection model and a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for enhanced data processing.

## Installation

To set up the project, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary data in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main script to start the aiming algorithm:

```bash
python scripts/main.py
```

## Directory Structure

- `models/`: Contains model definitions, including facial recognition and YOLO.
- `quantum/`: Quantum processing components, including the QCNN.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for directory management, screen capture, etc.
- `scripts/`: Main integration scripts that manage model execution and aiming algorithms.
